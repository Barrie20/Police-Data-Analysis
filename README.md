# Police-data-analysis

This GitHub repository contains a Python script for analyzing police data using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The script loads a dataset named 'Police Data.csv' and performs various data manipulation and exploration tasks. 

1. It loads the data using Pandas and displays the first 6 rows of the dataset using the `head()` function.
2. It then displays 4 random samples from the dataset using the `sample()` function.
3. The script also showcases the column names using the `columns` attribute and the shape of the dataset using the `shape` attribute.
4. Furthermore, it provides an overview of the data types of each column using the `dtypes` attribute.

The script demonstrates how to read, explore, and understand the structure of the police data, which includes columns such as stop date, stop time, driver gender, driver age, driver race, violation type, search status, outcome of the stop, and more.

This script serves as a helpful starting point for anyone interested in analyzing and visualizing similar police data using Python and popular data manipulation libraries. Feel free to explore and utilize this script for your data analysis projects or studies.
